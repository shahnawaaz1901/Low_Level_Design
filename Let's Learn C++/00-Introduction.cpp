/*
    Programming Language : A Programming Language is a Computer Language that
                is used by programmers to interact with the Computers. It's
                set of Instruction written by any language eg. C++, Java or Python
                to Perform a Specific Task.

    Compiler : We Know that computer understand only Binary Language (Zero or One)
                and if we want to interact with the computer then we need to give
                instruction in binary language, but we can't understand binary language
                we understand only normal langauge Like English or Hindi which is high
                level language, So how can we give instruction to the computer for this
                compiler is introduced which converts our high level english language in
                to the low level language so that we can communicate with Computers in
                easy manner and process of converting this higher level language into
                lower level language is called compilation process.

/*
    What is C++ : C++ is high level Programming Language created by Danish Computer
                Scientist Bjarne stroustrup.

    Why C++ :
        - Supports Objected Oriented Programming
        - Control Over System Resources and Memory
        - High Performance and Efficient

    Applications of C++ :
        - System Software Development
        - Game Development
        - Real time System

/*
    Source Code : Any Instruction written in Programming Language is Called
            Source Code

    Executable Code : Binary Code is Called Executable Code which is Generated
            After the Compilation Process because computer understand only binary
            language
