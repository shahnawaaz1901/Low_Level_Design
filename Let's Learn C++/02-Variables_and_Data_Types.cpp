        In Programming We Many Data is Interchange and access, But how can we
        identify that we need to a certain data because data is much much, so
        how can we know that this is the data what we want, So for this problem
        a Concept name "Variable" is introduced, Which is nothing but a name of
        the data, that name is linked with the memory where data is stored so
        that we can able to access the data using Variable, But in case of variable
        we can change the value of variable whenever we want to change
    */

    /*
        In C++ when We Want to Declare a Variable we need to first Specify the data
        type of the data then we write the name of the variable whatever we want then
        we assign it to some value. But now question is what is Data Type, Data type
        is an identifier which denotes which type of data user want to store, our
        compiler is also assign memory to a varible by checking the data type of the
        Variable, Because different different kind of data needs different different
        size in the memory

    /*
        Understand this line One by One
        first we write "int", Because C++ is statically typed Language so that we need
        to specify the data type by the value which we want to store, so first we write
        "int" which is data type next we write "x", this x is nothing but a variable name
        means when ever we want to access this data we can access by using the name of
        variable "x", equal sign use to assign some value in the variable, means the actual
        value which we want to store.
